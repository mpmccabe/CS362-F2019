Our group determined that this was not a bug.  
The while loop described in the original bug report runs for as 
long as the player has not chosen a valid card.  The hand is reset 
and updateCoins runs and the coins are counted correctly for each 
treasure card in the hand.  Because the player’s hand is all blank, 
the player’s coin count becomes 5 but will not leave the loop until 
the player buys something. When the function returns, playCard then 
updates the coin count correctly because the hand has been restored.
